### clrDV: A differential variability test for RNA-Seq data based on the skew-normal distribution

Hongxiang Li and Tsung Fei Khang

### clrDV: 
       A statistical method for detecting genes/transcripts in RNA-Seq data that show differential variability between two populations. 
       clrDV is based on a compositional data analysis framework. The skew-normal distribution is used for modeling gene-wise null 
       distribution of centered log-ratio transformed RNA-Seq data.

### Installation:
  devtools::intall_github("Divo-Lee/clrDV")
  
### Dependencies:
  clrDV R package depends on following R packages: sn, vioplot, stats, utils, grDevices, graphics.
