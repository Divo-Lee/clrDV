Description: clrDV is a statistical method for detecting genes/transcripts in RNA-Seq data that show differential variability between two populations. clrDV is based on a compositional data analysis framework. The skew-normal distribution is used for modeling gene-wise null distribution of centered log-ratio transformed RNA-Seq data.
